# niMPP - Multiplayer Piano in NIM

This is a MPP (Multiplayer Piano) bot entirely written Nim-Lang.  
  
The structure is pretty weird, but this is my 2nd project in nim and it's very hard, but very fun nontheless.  
To use this, you have to ask `Lapis#7110` for a bot token, and create a new file in `src/token.txt` with your token inside.
